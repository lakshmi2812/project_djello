# project_djello
Project management with that great wobbly taste!

Djello is a mock of the famous Trello app.
For example, on 'DJELLO', you can create a 'Board' for a project.
The different sprints in the project can each have a 'List' of their own.
Each List can have a 'Card's for specifying the tasks.


Steps to run the project:
==========================
1. Clone the repository into a local directory.
2. cd into the server directory. Run 'npm install' from your command line.
3. Then, run 'npm run seeds'. This will populate the database.
4. cd into the client directory. Again run 'npm install'.
5. Now, from the client directory, run 'npm start'. This will run the project.
6. So far, the ability to create a new board and deleting existing boards has been implemented.
7. The work on CRUD operations for Lists and Cards is in progress.
